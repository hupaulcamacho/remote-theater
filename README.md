# Remote Theater
Our application allows users to watch movies as if they were in a real movie theater. When a users signs on they are greeted with top rated movies and suggested movies based on their preferences. Every movie will have a specific showtime for when users can enter a showroom, before entering the theater users are greeted by a small decription of the movie and a time that shows how long the movie has been playing for. Once in the showroom users are able to leave comments and reactions in real time with our chat feature. Users are able to select preferences on the kind of movies they enjoy.
